Features of OOP 💡

Class 📚: A blueprint for creating objects (like a recipe for cookies 🍪).

Object 🎯: The actual instance created from the class (like a cookie 🍪 made from the recipe).

Encapsulation 🛡️: Wrapping code into neat little packages.

Inheritance 👨‍👧: Reusing properties from another class. (Dogs inherit from Animals 🐶🐾)

Polymorphism 🎭: One method, many forms!

Abstraction 💼: Only showing the essential features.

An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with attributes (properties) and behaviors (methods). Objects allow you to create multiple instances of a class, each with its own unique data

Components of OOP 🛠️

Constructor 🏗️:

A constructor is like a welcome party for your object! 🎉

It’s a special function that runs automatically when an object is created. 💫

Its main job is to set up the object’s properties and make sure everything is in place. 🔧

In Dart, the constructor has the same name as the class (no guessing games here!).

There are two main types of constructors in Dart, and they’re ready to bring your objects to life! 👾



Default constructor: A default constructor is automatically created if no other constructor is specified.

No parameter required.

Initializes instance variables to their default values ​​(null for objects, 0 for integers, etc.).

🔒 Data Encapsulation: Your Code's Secret Vault! 🔒

Data encapsulation keeps your class's implementation details safe from users, using an object's functions to control access. This enhances security and promotes cleaner code! 🌟

🚀 How to Achieve Encapsulation in Dart 🚀

Hide Your Secrets: Declare class properties as private by prefixing with an underscore (_). This locks away your valuable data! 📦🔒

Public Access: Create getter and setter methods to control access to private properties. These methods act as the keys to your vault! 🗝️💼

🏷️ Getter and Setter Methods: Your Access Control Team! 🏷️

Getter Methods: Friendly guides that safely reveal private property values—no risk of meddling! 🎤✨

Setter Methods: Vigilant bouncers that allow authorized changes to private properties—keeping your vault secure! 💃🎉
