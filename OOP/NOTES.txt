Features of OOP 💡

Class 📚: A blueprint for creating objects (like a recipe for cookies 🍪).

Object 🎯: The actual instance created from the class (like a cookie 🍪 made from the recipe).

Encapsulation 🛡️: Wrapping code into neat little packages.

Inheritance 👨‍👧: Reusing properties from another class. (Dogs inherit from Animals 🐶🐾)

Polymorphism 🎭: One method, many forms!

Abstraction 💼: Only showing the essential features.

An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with attributes (properties) and behaviors (methods). Objects allow you to create multiple instances of a class, each with its own unique data
