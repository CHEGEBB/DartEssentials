📘 Dart Data Types – Notes + Examples
🧠 What are Data Types?
In Dart, data types define the kind of data a variable can hold — like numbers, text, or true/false values.


📝 Notes:

int: Whole numbers (e.g., 1, 45, -3)

double: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5)

Strings are like the magic scrolls 📜 of your code—they store all your text-based data and messages. With Dart, you can craft and manipulate text using strings!

Booleans store the true or false logic of your code—a key ingredient in decision-making!

Are you asleep?
Is the door open?
Does a cat fly?
Are you older than your father?

These all are yes/no questions. Its a good idea to store them in boolean.

Dart List is similar to an array, which is the ordered collection of the objects. If you want to store multiple values without creating multiple variables, you can use a list.

A map is a dynamic collection that represents a set of values ​as key-value pairs. Keys and values ​in the

map can be of any type.
