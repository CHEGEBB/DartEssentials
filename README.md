## 🌟 About This Repo

This repository is a **collection of simple, clear, and well-commented Dart example files** designed for beginners starting to learn Dart.  
Here, I document my learning process step-by-step, covering the fundamental concepts and practical usage of Dart, including:

- 🔤 **Variables & Data Types**  
- 🔀 **Control Flow (if, else, switch)**  
- 🔁 **Loops (for, while, do-while, for-in)**  
- 🖥️ **User Input from the Terminal**

Each example is kept small and focused, making it easy to follow and understand.  
Whether you are brand new to programming or coming from another language, this repo is a friendly starting point for Dart!
