📘 Dart Variables – Notes + Code Snippets
🧠 What is a Variable?
A variable is used to store data in memory. You give it a name, assign a value, and then use it later.

📝 Notes:

var can store any value.

Once assigned, the type is fixed. You can’t change age to a String later.

We can also explicitly declare variables using keywords like String,int bool
Good for clarity and readability.

Use explicit types when the type is important.

dynamic allows changing type later (not recommended unless necessary).
