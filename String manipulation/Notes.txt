String Manipulation in Dart

Importance:

String manipulation is essential for processing and formatting text data in programming, such as generating messages, formatting user input, or performing text-based calculations.

Common Operations:

Concatenation: Concatenation combines two or more strings into one. Dart uses the + operator for this.

Interpolation: String interpolation allows embedding variables directly within a string. Dart uses $ for simple variables and ${} for expressions.

Substring: The substring() method extracts a portion of a string by specifying start and end indices.
